# GitHub Skill Research

Research reusable AI-agent skill patterns from real repositories and primary documentation.

## Workflow

1. Define the research target
   - Identify whether the user wants structure, trigger logic, workflow design, operating rules, examples, portability, or repository organization.
   - If the target is unclear, make a narrow useful assumption and state it.

2. Search sources
   - Prioritize real repositories with `SKILL.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, prompt libraries, workflow playbooks, or MCP/tooling examples.
   - Prefer official documentation and maintained repositories over generic blog advice.
   - Include `thananon/9arm-skills` as a useful comparison point when evaluating concise skill structure.

3. Analyze examples
   - Extract frontmatter style, trigger descriptions, workflow steps, output formats, safety rules, bundled resources, and repo layout.
   - Identify whether each pattern is portable across agents or tied to one tool.

4. Compare against the user's repo
   - Mark patterns to copy, adapt, skip, or keep private.
   - Call out duplication, overbroad skills, stale instructions, and missing validation.

5. Produce recommendations
   - Respond in the user's language.
   - Include links or local file paths.
   - Keep templates short enough to install or edit immediately.

## Rules

- Do not summarize sources without links or file paths.
- Do not copy a skill verbatim unless the user asks.
- Keep trigger logic in YAML `description`.
- Prefer workflows with verification over advice-only prompts.
